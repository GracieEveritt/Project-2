## Project Description
Build a website from API using react & to have fun.

## API Reference
- Source 1 - by country: Coronavirus confirmed cases, deaths, and recovered cases and every day since Jan 22, 2020.  
(https://github.com/pomber/covid19)  

- Source 2 - by city & country (can filter by country):
      const res = await fetch("https://covid-19-coronavirus-statistics.p.rapidapi.com/v1/stats?country=Canada", {
          "method": "GET",
          "headers": {
            "x-rapidapi-host": "covid-19-coronavirus-statistics.p.rapidapi.com",
            "x-rapidapi-key": "6aebfd9cf1mshf5ff7c3037601f8p1d234bjsndbb38607cd6d"
          }
        });

- [x] Why this API: it's relevant -- many ways to filter data and visually display into separate components
